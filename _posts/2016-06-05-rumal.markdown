Want to test out the tool ? You can quickly run an instance of Rumal via this docker installation and scan using [Thug](http://buffer.github.io/thug/) for malicious websites.
This docker version is only to be used for testing purposes.
Feel free to post up an issues you encounter on our [github page](https://github.com/thugs-rumal/rumal_docker).


# Installation 

System-wide requirements:

- Docker

    
**Docker:**

You will need docker to be able to build dockefiles, follow the instructions on [this link](https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/) on your respective system. You will need to be able to run the command ```docker-compose```.


**Getting docker verision**

You can directly clone the GitHub repository like so:

```sh
$ git clone  https://github.com/thugs-rumal/rumal_docker.git
```

Or download directly the [zip](https://github.com/thugs-rumal/rumal_docker/zipball/master) or [tar.gz](https://github.com/thugs-rumal/rumal_docker/tarball/master).


**Building Dockerfile**

```sh
$ cd rumal_docker
$ docker-compose build
```

**Run**

The following command will create ```rumaldocker_backend_1``` and ```rumaldocker_frontend_1``` and run the two containers

```sh
$ docker-compose up 
```

Your instance of rumal-thug is now ready to use. 

Rumal backend is running on (IP):8000/admin.  
Rumal front end will be running on (IP):8080.

# Connection

* **Windows:**  
    Go to [192.168.99.100:8080](http://192.168.99.100:8080) to access Rumal. This IP address might be different for you, see **Find default IP address** if it doesnâ€™t work. On Windows the Docker daemon is inside a Linux VM. So to connect to it you need to find out this VM's local IP address.

* **Ubuntu:**  
    [127.0.0.1:8080](http://127.0.0.1:8080) should work to access Rumal.  

* **Login:**    
    *Default user*: admin  
    *Default password*: admin  




**Find default IP address:**

Docker is configured to use the default machine with IP <192.168.99.100>(This is the IP address you use to connect to server).
IP address can be found by running this on your host machine: 

```sh
$ docker-machine ip
```  

OR  
The IP address displayed at the top of the Docker Quick start Terminal

# Tests
This has been tested on :  

-  Ubuntu 16.04 Desktop / Docker version 1.11.0
