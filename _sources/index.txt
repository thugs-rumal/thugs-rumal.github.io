Welcome to Rumal's documentation!
=================================

From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia:
    
    A rumāl is a piece of clothing similar to a handkerchief or bandana. [...] The rumāl was used by the Thugs in India as a method of strangulation. A coin was knotted in one end of the scarf, and would be swung around the neck of the victim; who would then be strangled in the most brutal and abhorrent manner.
    
This project aims to be `Thug <http://buffer.github.io/thug/>`_’s dress - providing a convenient web GUI - but also its weapon, as it should provide a set of tools that should enrich Thug’s output with new metadata and allow for correlation of results.


While it is perfectly possible to use it as a simple web GUI for Thug on your own computer, with you as the only user, Rumāl has been designed to support multi-user environments, where a single back-end can serve to multiple front-ends. Also, work is in progress to extend Rumal so that that you can comfortably share your results, settings, etc. resulting in easy collaboration with other users.
