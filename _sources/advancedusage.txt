Configure Default Plugins

**Geo Plugin:**

The geo plugin was developed to enrich Thug's data by showing the location of all nodes in the scan tree.

This requires a GeoPlugin.conf config file in /conf/plugins directory with the following: 

.. code-block:: bash

	[db_path]
	city = /absolute/path/to/your/db/file
	anonymous_ip = None
	connection_type = None
	isp = None

	[dbs]
	city = True
	anonymous_ip = False
	connection_type = False
	isp = False


We use the `GeoLite2 Free database <http://dev.maxmind.com/geoip/geoip2/geolite2/>`_ from MaxMind. Download GeoLite2 City database and provide the absolute path to the mmdb file.
